# In "Understanding Priority-Based Scheduling of Graph Algorithms on a
# Shared Memory Platform" work, Yesil et al found optimal deltas for OBIM,
# depending on benchmark and graph type.
# For BFS and MST delta=0 was selected. For SSSP and A*, delta=0 for
# web graphs and delta=14 for real-world road graphs.
# As long as non optimal delta can lead to unbearably slow execution, we
# decided not to go through all deltas, but to investigate the neighbourhood.

# Used for BFS, MST and SSSP & A* with network graphs.
# The following deltas to be reflected on heatmaps:
# { d | d in DELTAS & d >= DELTA_SMALL_MIN & d <= DELTA_SMALL_MAX }
DELTA_SMALL_MIN=0
